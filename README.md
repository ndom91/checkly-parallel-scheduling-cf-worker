# 🦝 Checkly Failing Countries Worker

Cloudflare Worker which exposes a Web UI to control which requests should be responded to as a failure (`500`). This allows geographic testing of monitoring tooling as requests to the exact same endpoint from the US, for example, will pass, but requests from Brazil will fail.

## ⚙️ Setup

See `wrangler.toml` for IaaC definition.

Manual setup can be done as follows:

1. Create `parallelScheduling` KV namespace and add a KV entry `failingCountries: {}`.
2. Deploy `src/index.ts` as a Cloudflare Worker
3. Hit the endpoint generated by Cloudflare
